# Instead of building a new `portfolio` from scratch,
# a good exercice would be to improve this old one
### Possible steps to improve and why :
- Convert all images to webp file format for best performance - old safari browsers are not compatible, work-around ?
- Update everything first : jquery, bootstrap and the 14 js lib used at that time (compare and test performance)
- Integrate all the js updated into one only file : allScript.js (compare and test performance)
- Review each lib again, what they do and how
- Test other relevant replacements if needed
- add a Modal for RGPD purpose
- Upgrade bootstrap 3.x.x to the last 4.x.x then to the last 5.x.x
- Review the old sass file, import only necessary bootstrap 5 modules into custom.scss
- Review the html
- See if a webpack 5 implementation worth it
