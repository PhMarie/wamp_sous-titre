# Instead of building a new `portfolio` from scratch,
# a good exercice would be to improve this old one
### Possible steps to improve and why :
- Convert all images to webp file format for best performance - old safari browsers are not compatible, work-around ?
- Update everything to the maximum first : jquery, bootstrap and the 14 js lib used at that time (compare and test performance)
- Integrate all the js updated into one only file : myAllscript.js (separate each lib by a comment containing "MY", compare and test performance)
- Review each lib again, what they do and how
- Test other relevant replacements if needed
- add a Modal for RGPD purpose
- Trying to upgrade bootstrap 3.x.x to the last one 5.X.X available
- Review the old sass file
- Review the html to improve it
- See if a webpack implementation worth it
